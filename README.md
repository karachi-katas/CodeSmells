# Code Smells Kata

**Smelly Tic Tac Toe**

We created a very smelly implementation of TicTacToe. There are quite a few code smells in the implementation: 

**Bloaters**
* Long method
* Long parameter list
* Primitive obsession
* Data clump
* Large class

**Couplers**
* Feature envy
* Message chain

**Change Preventers**
* Divergent change
* Shotgun surgery

**Dispensables**
* Lazy class
* Data class
* Comments
* Dead code
* Duplicated code

Start by identifying the smells and then slowly refactor the code. Remember to keep the tests passing at all times during the refactor. It's ok to revert back to a previous working state at any moment.
